# SNHU-CS-330

While working on my 3D scene project, I learned a lot about how I personally approach designing software. One big design skill I improved was thinking ahead about how different parts of the code will connect. I had to carefully plan how objects like shapes, lighting, and camera movement would all fit together. My design process was to start simple—like placing one object—and then build layer by layer, adding features like textures, colors, and transformations. In future work, I think this step-by-step layering tactic will help me stay organized and avoid being overwhelmed.

When it comes to developing programs, I started using more trial-and-error strategies while working on the 3D scene. I would code a small piece, test it, and tweak it before moving on. Iteration was a huge part of my development, because every time I changed something like lighting or object position, I had to see how it affected the full scene and then adjust. Over the milestones, I became more comfortable making small improvements instead of trying to get everything perfect on the first try, which made the whole project come together more smoothly.

Learning computational graphics definitely gave me skills that can help with my future education and career. Being able to break down complex visuals into code will help in classes that involve simulations, game design, or even data visualization. Professionally, graphics and visualizations are useful in fields like software development, UI/UX design, and any career that needs strong problem-solving and creativity skills. This project helped me realize how much computer science can open up different career paths I hadn't really thought about before.
